# Paged-Segmentation

This project implements Paged Segmentation.
Paged Segmentation is a memory management technique that divides a processâ€™s address space into segments and then divides each segment into pages. This allows for a flexible allocation of memory, where each segment can have a different size, and each page can have a different size within a segment.
